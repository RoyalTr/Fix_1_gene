The following only has to be done once and not for every project.
======================
Step 1: Install Python on Windows if not already installed.
Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
Click the latest Python 3.x.x version for Windows.
Click the box that says: "Add Python to PATH"
Click "Install Now"

Step 2: Open the Command Prompt
Press Windows + R, type cmd, then press Enter.

To find all the python versions installed on your PC, enter
cd C:\Users\ME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\
where ME is your user directory on that PC.
Type: dir
You will see one or more directory names, for example:
Python313
Python39

Pick the highest Python version number we'll call PythonXXX (e.g., Python313)
Type: cd PythonXXX,
where XXX refers to the Python directory number, e.g. 313.
Type: python --version
You should get a reply like for example Python 3.13.3

Step 3: Install Git for Windows (if not already done) using an Internet browser:
https://git-scm.com/downloads
Click on "Windows"
Click on "Click here to download"
Store the file into your download directory and then double click on that file (it is called something like Git-*.exe).
Accept the default installation directory, C:\Program Files\Git and all the other default recommendations.
======================

The following has to be done for a new project.
In the cmd window, navigate to a folder where you want the project directory to be created and installed. For example:
Type: cd C:\Users\ME\
where ME is the user name directory on your computer.

Type: git clone https://github.com/RoyalTr/Fix_1_gene.git               

This creates a folder called "Fix_1_gene" with all the code inside.

Step 4: Create a Virtual Environment
Type: cd Fix_1_gene
Type: C:\Users\ME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\\python.exe -m venv venv
Be sure to first replace ME by your user name and PythonXXX by the python director number you want to use!

Type: venv\Scripts\activate

Type: pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 6: Run the Program
Type: python fix_1_gen.py

Optional but recommended: Create a .bat script to run everything easily later:

@echo off
cd /d C:\Users\ME\Fix_1_gene
call venv\Scripts\activate
python fix_1_gene.py
pause

Store as a text file called Run_Fix_1_gene.bat in a directory like C:\Users\ME,
where ME is your user name directory on the PC.

To test, exit the cmd and then start cmd again.
Type: Run_Fix_1_gene
from any directory.

Note: After running Run_Fix_1_gene.bat with the internal variable document_results_every_generation = True
in Fix_1_gene, one can then type: python aver_each_gen_per_attempt_and_sim.py
to format the file results_data_per_generation.txt that had been created.

======================

Everything should now be installed. You can change the simulation parameters in the file C:\Users\ME\input_data.txt.
The resulting *.txt files contain the data with each column separated by ';'. These files can be used with spreadsheets or other software to generate graphics.
